    "*SiReNetA* is built upon the array object definition of [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and it uses functions from the [SciPy](https://scipy.org) library. Running these tutorials also requires [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for plotting and visualization purposes. The installation of *SiReNetA* will check for the presence of these libraries and install them if not available, see the file 'requirements.txt' in [SiReNetA](https://github.com/mb-BCA/SiReNetA).\n",

    "## 3. Example Analysis of a Network Stimulus-Response\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind *SiReNetA* is to reveal the properties of networks by probing how the nodes of a network respond localised perturbations. That is, to apply a stimulus of unit amplitude to one node and observe how the other nodes respond over time. The manner in which the stimulus propagates throughout the network depends on the dynamical propagation dynamical model selected. Network metrics are then extracted out of the pair-wise, node-wise or global responses, depending on whether nodes are stimulated individually or jointly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For illustration, we will load the small graph (binary and undirected) depicted below and visualise the network response at various levels for the leaky (continuous) cascade propagation model. For this model, the time to peak provides an approximation for the geodesic distance [Zamora-López and Gilson](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0202241).\n",
